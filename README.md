In this Project I have done full web Development Project which comprises

+ HTML

+ JAVASCRIPT
+ EJS(EMDEDDED JAVASCRIPT TEMPLATING)
+ MONGO DB
+ NODE. JS
+ EXPRESS

I have done simple **Yelpcamp-Project** to demonstrate the CRUD operation using the campgorunds for 
1. Create
2. Update
3. Delete
4. Modify

which allows to validate the user login credentials and look after the various campgrounds they can visit and there will be reviews about the campground who had already visited and we can also add the review about the campgrounds.

1. They can **add/Delete** their own reviews they have posted.
2. They can also **Add/Delete/Modify/Update** various campgrounds.
3. You can also Visit Various campgrounds and their views about the campgrounds and the images, price of the campgrounds 
4. It can also validate the each and every page that I have created in this project
5. It also pops up the successfull or deleted notfication once we have created or deleted or modified some campgrounds, reviews
6. once the user creates a new login, Add campground, reviews it provided with the **Unique ID and Details**
7. I have used the **Mongo DB** Store the details of the campgrounds details and reviews
